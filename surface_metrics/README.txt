NOTE: The 'geodiv' and 'srm' folders contain identical R projects as of 
8 May 2019. Both are included because we decided on a package name (geodiv), but
there are some a couple of funding submissions in review that go to 
.../surface_metrics/srm/. The 'geodiv' R project is the up-to-date version of 
the R package.
