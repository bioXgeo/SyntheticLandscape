\title{Estimate minimum correlation length.}
\usage{
.mindist(threshold, Aalpha, aacfimg)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{A number with a value between 0 and 1. Indicates
the autocorrelation value to which the rates of decline are measured.}

\item{Aalpha}{An list of dataframes produced by \code{scl()} that contain
the AACF values along lines extending in multiple directions from the
AACF origin (autocorrelation = 1).}

\item{aacfimg}{A raster of the areal autocorrelation function. This
is the AACF raster split in two in terms of height.}
}
\value{
A list containing the minimum distances from an
  autocorrelation value of 1 to the specified autocorrelation value < 1.
  Distances are in the units of the x, y coordinates of the raster image.
}
\description{
Internal function to calculates the minimum distances to specified
autocorrelation values (e.g., 0.2) of the areal autocorrelation
function (AACF). All 180 degrees from the origin of the AACF image
are considered for the calculation.
}
\examples{
# import raster image
data(normforest)

# calculate aacf img and matrix
aacf_list <- aacf(normforest)

# estimate the fastest/slowest declines to 0.20 and 0.37 (1/e) autocorrelation
sclvals <- scl(aacf_list[[2]])

# calculate Scl20, the minimum distance to an autocorrelation value of 0.2 in the AACF
Scl20 <- sclvals[[1]]
