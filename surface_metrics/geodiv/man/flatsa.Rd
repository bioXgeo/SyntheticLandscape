\title{Surface Area of a Flattened Raster}
\usage{
flatsa(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A raster object.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the scaled surface
  area of a flattened raster with the same x, y bounds.
}
\description{
Calculates the surface area of a flat raster with the
same x, y bounds as the study raster.
}
\details{
This function scales both x and y to between 0 and 1. This
is done because most satellite data have units where the x,
y units do not equal the z units and because the flat
surface area is usually compared to the actual surface area.
Surface area is calculated over the sample area (N-1, M-1).

\examples{
# import raster image
data(normforest)

# calculate flattened surface area
flatsa(normforest)
